{{{header(core,Richard Westhaver,ellis@rwest.io,The Compiler Company Core)}}}
This repository contains a collection of software libraries shared
across all of our products and projects.

- NOTE :: This is *not* a portable library. Starting in version =1.0=
  we will be depending on separately distributed forks of SBCL and
  Rust. See details here.

To bootstrap the core you will need recent versions of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]],
[[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]], and [[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]]. For SBCL you will need to build from source with
=:sb-core-compression= enabled[fn:1].

We have a strong preference for vendoring our dependencies. The
'super-repos' [[https://lab.rwest.io/comp/shed][shed]] and [[https://lab.rwest.io/comp/stash][stash]] contain all relevant source trees which
we build via CI and ship to production as well as use internally.
