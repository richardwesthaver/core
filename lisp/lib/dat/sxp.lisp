definition. This differs from the generic function `unwrap' which
always uses the ast slot as an internal buffer. We can also call this
on any class instance (doesn't need to subclass `sxp').

SLOTS specifies the slots to be included in the output. If the value
is t, all slots are included. The ast slot is not included by default,
but this behavior may change in future revisions.

When INDIRECT is non-nil, also include methods which indirectly
specialize on OBJ.

When TAG is non-nil, return a cons where car is TAG and cdr is the
output. If TAG is t, use the class-name symbol."
